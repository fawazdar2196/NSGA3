# üå± NSGA-III: Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm

This repository contains a Python implementation of the **NSGA-III (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III)**, a state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm designed for solving **multi-objective optimization problems**.  

The implementation includes modules for selection, crossover, mutation, reference point generation, and performance evaluation using standard metrics.

## üìå Overview
- **NSGA-III** extends the well-known NSGA-II algorithm by introducing **reference points** for better diversity preservation in many-objective optimization.  
- The algorithm is particularly effective when dealing with problems with **more than three objectives**.  
- This project provides a modular and extensible Python framework to test NSGA-III on different benchmark functions or real-world optimization tasks.
